        Find minimum eating speed k where Koko can eat all bananas within h hours.
        Uses binary search to efficiently find the minimum valid speed.

        Args:
            piles: List of integers where piles[i] is number of bananas in pile i
            h: Hours available to eat all bananas

        Returns:

        Time Complexity: O(n * log(m)) where n is number of piles and m is max pile size
        Space Complexity: O(1) as we only use constant extra space
