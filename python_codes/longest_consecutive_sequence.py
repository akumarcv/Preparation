    """
    Find length of longest consecutive sequence in an unsorted array.
    Uses set data structure for O(1) lookups and optimizes by only checking
    sequence starts (numbers that have no left neighbor).

    Args:
        nums: List of integers (can be unsorted, contain duplicates)

    Returns:
        int: Length of longest consecutive sequence

    Time Complexity: O(n) where n is length of input array
    Space Complexity: O(n) for storing numbers in set

    Example:
        >>> longest_consecutive_sequence([100,4,200,1,3,2])
        4  # Longest sequence is [1,2,3,4]
